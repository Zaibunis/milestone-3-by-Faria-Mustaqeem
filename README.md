Objective:
Use TypeScript to add products dynamically to the inventory table. 

Requirements:

and price. 
 Use TypeScript to loop through the array and display the products in the HTML table. 

Scoring Breakdown:
 TypeScript Integration (30 points):
Are you able to display products from a TypeScript array into the HTML table? 

 Array and Looping (20 points):
Is the array properly structured and looped through using TypeScript?
